     <h2>1. What Is Coding ?</h2>
<p>Coding, also known as computer programming, is how we communicate with computers and tell them what to do.
 <br> Through coding, professionals can build programs, including websites and apps. Coding creates a set of
<br>  instructions for computers to follow. These instructions determine what actions a computer can and 
<br> cannot take. Computer programmers can also tell computers how to process data in better, faster ways. 
<br> computer programmers split coding languages into two groups: low-level and high-level.</p>
     

    
<p>
<b>High languages </b> , like binary, are considered "machine-oriented." Machine-oriented languages 
<br> write instructions that must be specified in terms of the capabilities of the processor in question.
<br>  Coders also refer to
<b> low -languages</b> as assembly language or machine code. </p>

<p>High-level coding languages are closern to human language — they include more nuance and adaptability
 <br>than low-level coding languages.</p>

<h2> 2. How It Works? </h2>
<p>To speak with computers, programmers learn different coding languages. Binary code is the primary 
<br>language of all computers. Binary code consists of only two numbers: one and zero. In the binary coding 
<br>language, zero represents "off" while one represents "on". Binary is still used with electronics and 
<br> computer hardware. Programmers can use binary to control the flow of electricity and the positive and 
<br> negative poles of a magnet. Binary code allows programmers to create simple instructions and procedures
<br> for computers.</p>
 
<h2> 3. Benefits of Coding </h2>
 <b>Elevate your career prospects </b>: <p> Regardless of whether you work in the tech industry, learning at least
<br> one programming language can help you to stand out from the competition in an interview process or help you 
<br> negotiate a higher salary</p>
<br>
<b> <p> Improve your problem- solving skills </b>: <p>Many people who learn to code report an improved ability to 
<br> break problems down into smaller pieces and approach problem with clearer, linear thinking.</p>
<br> 
<b>Cultivate creativity</b>: <p> Coding gives you the ability to create anything you can dream of. </p>

These professionals typically 
<br> know multiple coding languages. They may work individually or as part of a team. </p>
<a href= "https://in.indeed.com/hire/job-description/web-developer?gclid=CjwKCAjwscGjBhAXEiwAswQqNJS3izDlty80IO2UKJaAMUDJFt_tvMKMq5wMpO6COy7MXxsrZgPRnxoCLSwQAvD_BwE&aceid=&gclsrc=aw.ds"> <u> Web developer </u> </a>
<p> Web developers work with their clients to create websites and apps. These professionals can work on front-end
<br>and/or back-end development. Web developers may also consult about the functionality of existing websites. </p>
 <a href="https://in.indeed.com/hire/job-description/database-administrator?gclid=CjwKCAjwscGjBhAXEiwAswQqNIJFko6sVuw6Au42HDaFv1nUlqTiccHg-YdQXT_J0dWvBWZFTX0dxRoCfHMQAvD_BwE&aceid=&gclsrc=aw.ds"> <u> Data base administrator </u> </a>
<p>These professionals create and/or manage computer systems that store data. Administrators also ensure that user 
<br> data remains secure, either from external attacks or internal data loss. </p>
<a href= "https://in.indeed.com/hire/job-description/software-developer?gclid=CjwKCAjwscGjBhAXEiwAswQqNAdEro9t07TEdEYnBGskhvZOEDX3tHgEIyk1WhQeguLTHfgN192pjBoCQp4QAvD_BwE&aceid=&gclsrc=aw.ds"> <u> Software developer </u> </a>
<p> Software developers create new software and upgrades for existing programs. These professionals also oversee software 
<br> testing and development, sometimes consulting with other tech professionals to create a streamlined product.  </p>
<a href= "https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-network-architects.htm#:~:text=Computer%20network%20architects%20create%20comprehensive,implement%20computer%20and%20information%20networks."> <u>Computer network architects</u>  </a>
<p> These professionals build data communication networks, including wide area networks and intranets. These networks may 
<br>be small-scale — such as a connection within an office — or as large scale as cloud computing. </p>
 
<h2>5.Where Can I Learn to Code? </h2>
 <p> You can attend a postsecondary program, such as an associate degree program and/or bachelor's degree program, 
 <br> to learn to code. However, there are additional options to learn to code that do not require enrolling in a 
 <br> degree program. Prospective programmers can learn to code through bootcamps, websites, and apps. </p>
 <br>
